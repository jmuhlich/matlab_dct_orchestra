matlab_dct_orchestra
====================

Workalike for Matlab's Distributed Computing Toolbox which does not require a
DCT license nor any per-worker licenses at all, designed specifically for the
HMS Orchestra cluster.

USAGE
-----

Use just like the DC toolbox, except you must first compile a wrapper function
for the function to be distributed.  See examples/test_scheduler.m for sample
usage.

To distribute the Matlab function "myfunc", copy examples/max_wrapper.m to
myfunc_wrapper.m, change all instances of "max" to "myfunc", and compile:

   mcc -m -R -singleCompThread,-nodisplay myfunc_wrapper.m

If myfunc uses random number generation without explicitly seeding the
generator, copy and modify rand_wrapper.m instead. (Otherwise all executions of
myfun will use the same random seed, which is probably not what is intended.)
